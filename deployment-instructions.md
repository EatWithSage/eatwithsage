# Deployment Instructions for Sage Brand Colors

## Current Status
✅ **Sage brand CSS restored**: All brand colors properly implemented in `client/src/index.css`
✅ **Build successful**: Production files created in `dist/` folder with compiled CSS containing brand colors
✅ **Colors included**: Sage green (#8A9A5B), forest accent (#052D24), cream background (#F7F5EF)

## Problem
The live site at https://www.eatwithsage.com/ still shows white/bland colors because the Vercel deployment is using old build files, not the updated ones with Sage branding.

## Solution
You need to deploy the new `dist/` folder to Vercel with the updated CSS. The build files in this Replit now contain the correct Sage brand colors.

### Next Steps:
1. Download the entire `dist/` folder from this Replit
2. Replace the deployment files on Vercel with the new build files
3. Or reconnect Vercel to pull from this updated repository

The CSS file `dist/assets/index-Dep1F9sc.css` contains all the Sage brand styling that will replace the white background with cream and add the proper green accents.
