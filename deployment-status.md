# Deployment Status Update

## Git Push Status
Your local repository shows the commit "Deploy Sage brand colors - production ready" is ready at HEAD, but the push to GitHub may need to be completed manually due to SSH/HTTPS configuration issues.

## Alternative Deployment Options

### Option 1: Manual Git Push (Recommended)
Try these commands in your Shell:

```bash
# Configure to use HTTPS instead of SSH
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/EatWithSage/eatwithsage.com.git

# Push your changes
git push origin main
```

If prompted for credentials, use your GitHub username and a Personal Access Token (not password).

### Option 2: Direct File Upload to GitHub
If Git push continues to fail, you can manually upload these key files to GitHub:

**Critical files for deployment:**
- `dist/assets/index-CYZkQNGO.css` (contains compiled Sage brand colors)
- `dist/assets/index-D3Xrzi6R.js` (updated JavaScript)
- `dist/index.html` (updated HTML)
- `tailwind.config.ts` (fixed configuration)

### Option 3: Verify Current Status
Check your GitHub repository at: https://github.com/EatWithSage/eatwithsage.com

If the latest commit shows "Deploy Sage brand colors - production ready", then the push was successful and Vercel should auto-deploy.

## Production Build Confirmed
✅ Your production files contain the compiled Sage brand colors (#8A9A5B, #052D24, #F7F5EF)
✅ Build process is working correctly
✅ Files are ready for deployment

The key issue was fixing the Tailwind configuration to use direct hex values instead of CSS variables, which now allows the brand colors to compile properly into the production CSS.
