# Deploy to Correct Repository: EatWithSage/eatwithsage

## Issue Identified
Your Git remote is currently pointing to:
- ❌ `https://github.com/EatWithSage/eatwithsage.com.git` (wrong)
- ✅ Should be: `https://github.com/EatWithSage/eatwithsage.git` (correct)

## Manual Deployment Steps

Since Git configuration is locked in this environment, you'll need to manually deploy your production files to the correct repository.

### Option 1: Manual Commands (Try in Shell)
```bash
# Remove any lock files
rm -f .git/config.lock .git/index.lock

# Set correct remote URL
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/EatWithSage/eatwithsage.git

# Verify the change
git remote -v

# Push to correct repository
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Manual File Upload
If Git commands continue to fail, manually upload these key files to the correct repository at `https://github.com/EatWithSage/eatwithsage`:

**Critical deployment files:**
1. `dist/assets/index-CYZkQNGO.css` (63,859 bytes) - Contains compiled Sage brand colors
2. `dist/assets/index-D3Xrzi6R.js` (380,719 bytes) - Updated JavaScript
3. `dist/index.html` - Updated HTML with correct asset references
4. `tailwind.config.ts` - Fixed configuration with direct hex values

### Option 3: Clone to New Directory
```bash
# In a new terminal/directory
git clone https://github.com/EatWithSage/eatwithsage.git
cd eatwithsage
# Copy your dist/ folder and other updated files here
# Then commit and push
```

## Files Ready for Deployment
✅ Production build contains compiled Sage brand colors (#8A9A5B, #052D24, #F7F5EF)
✅ All CSS and JavaScript files are updated and ready
✅ Build process verified working correctly

The key is getting these files to the correct repository: `EatWithSage/eatwithsage` (without .com)
