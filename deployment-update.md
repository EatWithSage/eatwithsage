# Vercel Deployment Update Instructions

## Updated Build Ready for Deployment

The production build has been successfully updated with the restored Sage brand colors. Here's what's been fixed:

### Build Contents
- **New CSS file**: `dist/assets/index-Dep1F9sc.css` (63.24 kB)
- **JavaScript file**: `dist/assets/index-BvtOP2Mj.js` (380.72 kB)
- **HTML file**: `dist/index.html` with proper Sage branding

### Sage Brand Colors Included
- Primary sage green: #8A9A5B
- Forest accent: #052D24  
- Cream background: #F7F5EF

### Next Steps for Vercel
1. **Deploy the updated `dist/` folder contents to Vercel**
2. **Ensure all files in `dist/assets/` are uploaded**
3. **Verify the new CSS file `index-Dep1F9sc.css` is included**

The build is now ready and contains all the restored Sage brand colors that are working in the preview.

### Alternative: Automatic Deployment
If you have auto-deployment set up, simply push the updated `dist/` folder to your repository and Vercel will automatically deploy the new version with the Sage branding.
