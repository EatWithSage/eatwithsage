# Push Updated Build to GitHub

Your repository is connected to: `github.com:EatWithSage/eatwithsage.com.git`

## Steps to Push the Updated Build:

### 1. Add all changes
```bash
git add .
```

### 2. Commit with descriptive message
```bash
git commit -m "Update Sage brand colors for Vercel deployment

- Fixed Tailwind config to use direct hex values instead of CSS variables
- Updated production build with compiled Sage brand colors (#8A9A5B, #052D24, #F7F5EF)
- Ready for Vercel deployment with restored branding
- New files: dist/assets/index-CYZkQNGO.css and index-D3Xrzi6R.js"
```

### 3. Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```

## What This Will Deploy:
- ✅ Updated `dist/` folder with compiled Sage brand colors
- ✅ New CSS file: `index-CYZkQNGO.css` (contains all 3 brand colors)
- ✅ New JS file: `index-D3Xrzi6R.js` 
- ✅ Updated HTML with correct asset references

## After Pushing:
If you have Vercel connected to this GitHub repository with auto-deployment enabled, it will automatically deploy the new version with the restored Sage branding.

If auto-deployment isn't set up, you can manually deploy the `dist/` folder contents to Vercel.
